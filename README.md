# Data-Science-project:
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning classification techniques. By analyzing medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate, the model classifies whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.

The goal of this project is to compare multiple machine learning algorithms and identify the model that provides the best prediction accuracy.

Objective
• To analyze a heart disease dataset
• To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models
• To accurately predict heart disease presence
• To compare model performance using evaluation metrics

Dataset Description
• Source: Heart Disease Dataset
• Type: Structured tabular data
• Target Variable:
• 1 → Presence of heart disease
• 0 → Absence of heart disease
• Features include:
• Age
• Sex
• Chest pain type
• Resting blood pressure
• Cholesterol
• Maximum heart rate
• And other clinical parameters

Technologies Used
• Python
• Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
• Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
• Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Machine Learning Models Used
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Tree Classifier
• Random Forest Classifier
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Training multiple machine learning models
5. Evaluating models using performance metrics
6. Comparing model results to select the best performer

Model Evaluation Metrics
• Accuracy Score
• Confusion Matrix
• Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Visualizations
• Correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships
• Target variable distribution
• Confusion matrix visualization for model performance
• Model accuracy comparison

Results

The project successfully predicts heart disease with good accuracy. Among the tested models, ensemble-based methods such as Random Forest generally provide better performance due to their ability to handle complex relationships within the data.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early detection of heart disease. Such predictive systems can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.
